## Viewing the Documentation

We produced Sphinx documentation, you can view it locally by opening the generated HTML files in your browser:

   ```bash
   open docs/_build/html/index.html
   ```

   - On **Linux**, use:
     ```bash
     xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html
     ```

   - On **Windows**, use:
     ```cmd
     start docs\_build\html\index.html
     ```

### Notes:
- Ensure you have built the documentation successfully before attempting to open the HTML file.
- The main landing page for the documentation is `index.html`.
